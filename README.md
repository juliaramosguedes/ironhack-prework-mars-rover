This project is a Ironhack's pre-work for Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.

In this exercise, the goal is to apply as many as possible of the concepts you have just learned:

* [x] how to work with different types of variables
* [x] how to manipulate nested data structures
* [x] how to define and invoke functions

We are sending a rover to Mars, and we need to be able to move it through a series of instructions sent from the Earth.

Our Mars Rover is too independent, let‚Äôs put it this way. By that, we mean it can‚Äôt move and turn at the same time. This means that if the rover wants to move to the left, its first move must be a turn. Its next move will then be a step forward.

Also, our rover is on a test mission. NASA has placed the rover on a 10x10 grid to make sure all is well before we ship it off to Mars.
